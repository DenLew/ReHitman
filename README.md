What is it?
===========

This is my try to reverse the executable of Hitman Blood Money. The final goal of this project is multiplayer in this game (like a Mafia 2 Mutliplayer)

About directories
==================

This project includes 2 directories:

 * Launcher    - Main DLL injector and runner of game

The goals
=========

 - [ ] Create open source SDK for Glacier 1 Engine
 - [ ] Create toolset for Hitman Blood Money
